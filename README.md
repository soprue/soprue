### Hi there ðŸ–¤
I am a **frontend developer** who is committed to user experience-centered development.  
Working as a web publisher, I have gained experience in user-centered development through leading user interviews and UX design. This has led me to realize the importance of user consideration for the success of a service.  
I have a strong interest in performance optimization and am continually monitoring and improving performance issues using Lighthouse.
